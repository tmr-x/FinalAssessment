Final Assessment Application.

This application involves basic login functionality integrated with an API. After a successful login, the home screen is displayed within a RecyclerView. Individual items are collected from the dashboard endpoint, and the application allows navigation to a details screen for each item.

-----------------------------------------------

OPENING THE APPLICATION:

1. Download the project files onto your local machine.

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Once the application is opened, you need to ensure that the correct SDK pathway has been defined. At times, there will be a popup on the screen that states the correct SDK pathway for your machine will be applied to the project. All you need to do is press ok, and continue. If this popup does not appear, go to Settings in the top-right hand corner of the toolbar. Click on 'SDK Manager'. In the editor that appears, find the section that specifies the 'Android SDK Location'. Next to the link, click the 'Edit' button, and continue to press Next until the SDK has been updated.

4. If the application opens with errors in the build.gradle file, go to the toolbar at the top of the screen. Click 'Build' and then 'Rebuild Project'

-----------------------------------------------

SETTING UP THE EMULATOR DEVICE:

1. To ensure you have the correct device to run the application, click on the 'Device Manager' at the right hand side of the screen. If there is no device titled "Pixel 2 API 35", click on the plus (+) button, click on 'Create Virtual Device'.

2. Search for the Pixel 2 device and add it to your device list.

Now the application can be run.

-----------------------------------------------

RUNNING THE APPLICATION:

1. In the toolbar at the top of the screen, click the run button that looks like a stereotypical 'Play' button (triangle). This will prompt the application to run.

2. If nothing appears, click on the 'Running Devices' tab on the right hand side of the window so that the emulator will appear.

-----------------------------------------------

USING THE APPLICATION:

1. The first screen show will be the login screen. The credentials have been hardcoded as the following:
username: Taylah
password: s4673381
Enter these credentials and click the 'Login' button.

2. After login, the home screen will show a list of languages fetched from the API. You can scroll to find 7 different languages. In order to scroll, you need to click on your mouse or trackpad, and move the cursor down or up as desired.

3. Click on any of the buttons that say 'More Info' to be taken to the dashboard screen where you will be shown further information about the language.

4. In order to get back to the home screen, locate the bar that appears above the Pixel 2 emulator. Click the back button that looks like a triangle.

-----------------------------------------------

STOPPING THE APPLICATION:

1. In order to stop the application from running, simply press the red stop button that appears as a cube, and is located in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

-----------------------------------------------

NOTE: If login does not work after entering the correct credentials, there may be an issue with the API not running correctly. This may be a temporary issue where you may be able to wait a few minutes until it is up and running again, or it may be a separate issue that cannot be fixed immediately.
